Challenge for Data Scientist - TOTVS Labs

The data extracted from the input [sample](sample.txt) corresponds to **m = 1635** transactions. We attribut to each transaction a number of features **n = 24**, where each feature represents a product (BUFFER, AGUA, etc).

We arrange the data in a **m x n** matrix, where each raw represents a transaction, and each column is a product. An element **X(i,j)** corresponds to the income generated by the product **j** in the transaction **i**.
