Challenge for Data Scientist - TOTVS Labs

The data extracted from the input [sample](sample.txt) corresponds to **m = 1635** transactions. Each transaction contains **n = 24** features, where each feature represents a product (**BUFFET**, **REFRIGERANTE**, etc).

We arrange the data in a **X(m,n)** matrix, where each raw represents a transaction, and each column is a product. An element **X(i,j)** corresponds to the income generated by the product **j** in the transaction **i**.

The analysis of the consuming pattern shows the product **BUFFET** as responsible for 84% of the income, followed by **REFRIGERANTE** (6 %) and **AGUA** (3 %). The following figure shows the consuming pattern; a table with all the products sorted by the average income is also shown.
